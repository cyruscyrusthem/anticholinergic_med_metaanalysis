## Data import



## Whole meta-analysis
### Step 1: Average across studies
This step is necessary to ensure independence of each effect size entered into the meta-analysis. 

Data are averaged:

* Within studies

  + For studies which only report comparisons with medication            categorised as **only** high or low potency
  
Saved into new data frame: `whole`


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
